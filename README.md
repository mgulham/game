## Psychic Game

An html game that uses javascript to define user inputs and create dynamic actions.

Game needed very simple front end work to focus on back end game logic (Javascript)

Started off the java by defining variables that will be changing as the user makes inputs

Decided that the game needed to tally score while taking in user input and comparing it to a randomized computer output that is chosen from an array. 

User inputs are changed to lowercase to avoid confusion

When user guess and computer guess are identical you get a win message and the game resets

When user guess and computer guess are not identical you lose a value from your guesses remaining

When Guesses remaining reach 0 you get a lose alert and the game resets.
